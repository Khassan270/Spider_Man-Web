  <p class="f1">Surprise, Nostalgia, Shock, Joy – all these emotions you will experience after watching my favorite movie “Spider-Man: No Way Home”. <br> This incredible movie released in December 2021, "Spider-Man: No Way Home" is an exciting new part of the famous franchise about the spider superhero. <br> Director of the movie-Jon Watts skillfully connected drama and action to create a unique experience for viewers is a superhero movie that delves deep into the Spider-Man mythology, bringing together multiple generations of Spider-Man fans. <br>This is the third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe where the main actor is Tom Holland, here the previous films: “Spider-Man: Homecoming” (2017), “Spider-Man: Far From Home” (2019). <br> This film is not just another new season in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it is a legendary event that brings previous Spider-Man film series into the new incredible story.</p>
  <br>
  <h2 class="main2">Plot:</h2>
  <p class="f2">The plot of the film becomes a real journey through the world of parallel universes. <br> The main character, Peter Parker, played by Tom Holland, is faced with a cataclysmic event. <br>The viewer is drawn into the drama, which consists of Peter's difficult choice: to leave the universes alone or to save those who live in them. <br> The plot develops in a complex but logical manner, and the viewer is kept in suspense until the very end. <br> But, let’s explain from the beginning what is going on, the movie starts with a lot of problems for Peter, due to all the world knowing that he is Spider-Man. <br> It makes a lot of legal trouble for Peter. Moreover, Peter is tired of the media, which controls his every step. <br>Peter wants to back to his normal life, he wants to make people forget that he is Spider-Man. <br>That is why he asked Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help, Peter wants Strange to use magic to make everyone forget that he is Spider-Man. <br> However, the spell goes wrong, and this is causing a break in the multiverse - this means that there are many different parallel universes. <br>This beak allows Spider-Man from older movies, to come into the new Marvel Cinematic Universe. <br>For me as a fan of the Spider-Man universe, this is an incredible performance, in one movie I can see all three adaptations of Spider-Man. <br> Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire, and Andrew Garfield this convergence of different Spider-Man’s universes creates a magical sense of nostalgia and excitement for us as fans who grew up watching these characters.</p>

  <h2 class="main3">Multiverse and Nostalgia:</h2>
  <p class="f3">It is crucial to understand the concept of multiverse in "No Way Home" because it provides a portal for integrating characters from different film franchises into a new single story. <br> The multiverse theory says that there are many different parallel universes. <br> The theory concept allows us to bring back previous Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire, and Andrew Garfield, who played the role of Spider-Man in earlier film adaptations. <br> This creates a sense of nostalgia for fans who grew up watching Spider-Man movies.</p>
  <br>
  <h2 class="main4">Enemies:</h2>
  <p class="f4">In addition to the heroes, their enemies also appear in this part of the movie. <br> However, even in this part of the franchise, the enemies gain depth and character, which makes them more interesting for the viewers. <br>The plot examines the motives for their actions and even evokes sympathy for some of them.</p>
  <h2 class="main5">Themes:</h2>
  <p class="f5">The movie explores a lot of crucial themes, one of which is that Peter needs to take all responsibility for his actions. <br> He needs to find a balance between normal and hero life. <br>In this part of the movie, a touching moment happens when Aunt May is dying, this crucial event helps Peter to grow up and become more responsible</p>
  <h2 class="main6">Visual effects:</h2>
  <p class="f6">This film is visually one of the best movies from Marvel. <br> Spider-Man’s fights between buildings, battles, and explosions look exciting and realistic, thanks to modern technology and to people who work on this film.  <br>The VFX team played a crucial role, due to the success of a film largely depends on the visuals. </p>
